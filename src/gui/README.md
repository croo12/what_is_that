# GUI Module

This module contains the graphical user interface (GUI) implementation for `my_cli_tool`.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to provide an interactive and visually appealing interface for users to interact with the underlying command execution logic. It abstracts away the complexities of the command-line interface, offering a more intuitive experience.

## Components

-   **`App` struct:** Implements the `eframe::App` trait, defining the main structure and behavior of the GUI application.
-   **UI Layout:** Handles the arrangement of widgets such as input fields, buttons, and output display areas.
-   **Event Handling:** Processes user interactions (e.g., button clicks, text input) and triggers corresponding actions.
-   **Command Execution Integration:** Orchestrates the execution of external commands and displays their output within the GUI.

## Dependencies

This module heavily relies on the `egui` and `eframe` crates for rendering the user interface and managing the application window.
