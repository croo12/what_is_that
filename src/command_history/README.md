# Command History Module

This module manages the history of executed commands, allowing for navigation and recall of previous inputs.

## Purpose

To encapsulate the logic for storing, retrieving, and navigating through command history, separating it from the GUI and command execution concerns. This promotes modularity and reusability.

## Components

-   **`CommandHistory` struct:** Holds the list of commands and the current position within the history.
-   **`add` method:** Adds a new command to the history.
-   **`navigate_up` method:** Moves the history pointer up to retrieve older commands.
-   **`navigate_down` method:** Moves the history pointer down to retrieve newer commands.
-   **`reset_index` method:** Resets the history pointer.

## Usage

This module will be integrated into the GUI to provide a seamless command history experience for the user.
